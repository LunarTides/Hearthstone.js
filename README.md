## Running
> See [the docs](https://hs.lunartides.dev/guides/installation/) for a more comprehensive guide.

You need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed.

- If you are on Windows, open `setup.bat`, then `run.bat`.
- Otherwise, open a console / terminal, then run `bun install`, and `bun .`
  (This works on all platforms.)

## Images

Here's what you can expect from Hearthstone.js

### HUB

<img width="1172" height="454" alt="Screenshot of the HUB" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b67a7c3-0f85-4c09-b2a6-2b5370e1dc36" />

This is the hub. It connects the different aspects of Hearthstone.js together,
allowing you to run the separate tools seamlessly.

### Generic game

<img width="935" height="555" alt="Screenshot of the game" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a78faf7-4e8c-4b0c-9e0e-0ff5be32c7d2" />

This is what the main game looks like. It might look different if the settings
under the `Debug` category are off.

### Commands

<img width="1919" height="795" alt="Screenshot of the game commands" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ec4dc1-1990-41f5-aa56-bb4d82c4af75" />

This is what is shown when you select `Commands` in-game. This list is scrollable,
and there are more commands out of view.

### Help message in-game

<img width="1919" height="795" alt="Screenshot of the help message in-game" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ec6efd2-80d2-4aa8-a755-641862132a7d" />

This is what is shown when you run the `help` command. As you can see, there is
a lot of commands that can be run.

### Deck Creator

<img width="1919" height="667" alt="Screenshot of the deck creator" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f159a034-ed1b-41b9-a0e5-5b42ec94e5aa" />

This is what the Deck Creator looks like. This is the tool that lets you create
a deck, and gives you its corresponding deckcode.

### Deck Creator commands

<img width="1919" height="600" alt="Screenshot of the deck creator's help message" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba875903-7ac6-4155-8823-35f7a17d7bb0" />

This is what is shown when you select `Commands` in the deck creator.

### Custom Card Creator

<img width="906" height="1042" alt="Custom card creator demo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6996305f-72a1-4662-bf60-51eabd524610" />

This is the custom card creator. It allows you to create custom cards. Not much else to be said.
See the [docs](https://hs.lunartides.dev/guides/creating/cards/generators/custom/) for more information.

### Vanilla Card Creator

<img width="1295" height="697" alt="Vanilla card creator demo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d537c7a3-e1bf-450b-b95c-86d7cb60b05c" />

This is the vanilla card creator. If set up right, it will allow you to import
_any_ card from Hearthstone.

### Vanilla Card Creator generated code (No manual lines of code written)

<img width="941" height="971" alt="Screenshot of the code generated by the vanilla card creator" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3e23b89-e19d-41de-a8b9-7e0fa9faed35" />

This is the code generated by selecting `Brann Bronzebeard` in the vanilla
card creator. The custom card creator will generate identical code.

### Functional code

<img width="776" height="1012" alt="Screenshot of the fixed generated code" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ec0be6e-85a8-4ed1-8f94-3a596b842a21" />

This is the same code, but cleaned up. I changed the event from `ChangeMe` to
`PlayCard`, and added `value.trigger(Ability.Battlecry)`. This makes Brann
Bronzebeard work properly.

### History

<img width="1608" height="1042" alt="Screenshot of the history command output" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1aa2837-7864-417f-bc78-40e9453fabc2" />

This is the result of running the `History` command in-game.
It shows a log of what has happened since the game started.
This is helpful for seeing what happened last turn.
