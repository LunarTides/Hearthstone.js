## Running

You need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed.

- If you are on Windows, open `setup.bat`, then `run.bat`.
- Otherwise, open a console / terminal, then run `bun install`, and `bun .`
  (This works on all platforms.)

## Images

Here's what you can expect from Hearthstone.js

### HUB

This is the hub. It connects the different aspects of Hearthstone.js together,
allowing you to run the seperate tools seamlessly.

### Generic game

<img width="1363" height="596" alt="Screenshot of the game" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cb2c764-8ca7-46bb-8011-75e0805a3e59" />

This is what the main game looks like. It might look different if the settings
under the `Debug` category are off.

### Help message in-game

<img width="1362" height="882" alt="Screenshot of the help message in-game" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7937dc0f-8ba6-48ba-b95f-b2299a2639d4" />

This is what is shown when you run the `help` command. As you can see, there is
a lot of commands that can be run.

### Deck Creator

<img width="1362" height="882" alt="Screenshot of the deck creator" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9347e736-59c5-4c73-8489-dee653efefd9" />

This is what the Deck Creator looks like. This is the tool that lets you create
a deck, and gives you its corresponding deckcode.

### Deck Creator help message

<img width="1363" height="1212" alt="Screenshot of the deck creator's help message" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5f27ede-83ac-413f-845b-cea8a514d2ab" />

This is what is shown when you run the `help` command in the deck creator. There
is a lot...

### Custom Card Creator

<img width="1363" height="561" alt="Custom card creator demo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72b15ea3-846c-4966-975a-52442a1449e4" />

This is the custom card creator. It allows you to create custom cards. Not much
else to be said. See the
[Wiki](https://github.com/LunarTides/Hearthstone.js/wiki/Adding-Cards) for more
information.

### Vanilla Card Creator

<img width="1365" height="600" alt="Vanilla card creator demo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4e82baf-9662-4064-9201-1448546ac956" />

This is the vanilla card creator. If set up right, it will allow you to import
_any_ card from Hearthstone, just by typing in its name.

### Vanilla Card Creator generated code (No manual lines of code written)

<img width="600" height="971" alt="Screenshot of the code generated by the vanilla card creator" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6325a872-f5bc-4cfd-a817-aa136c92a85e" />

This is the code generated by typing in `Brann Bronzebeard` into the vanilla
card creator. The custom card creator will generate identical code.

### Functional code

<img width="600" height="971" alt="Screenshot of the fixed generated code" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a7133b5-255c-4de4-8e01-3eceaec39866" />

This is the same code, but cleaned up. I changed the event from `ChangeMe` to
`PlayCard`, and added `value.trigger(Ability.Battlecry)`. This makes brann
bronzebeard work properly.

### Debug history (The normal history command shows less info)

<img width="1363" height="1212" alt="Screenshot of the /history command output" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dee4065b-37e4-4435-b2a9-e6639628be0b" />

This is the result of running `/history` when debug commands are enabled. It
shows a log of what has happened since the game started. This is just for
demonstrating how big Hearthstone.js is.
