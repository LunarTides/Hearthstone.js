# Examples
These are some example cards to (hopefully) teach you how to create your own cards in Hearthstone.js

You can give yourself any of these cards by having debug mode enabled (`config.toml`), and typing `/give The Card's Name` or `/give The Card's Id`.

Every stage has a big example card at the end, called `combined.ts`. This will show you every concept you learned in that stage, so look at that last.

Look at the name of the file to see the order you should look at it. Look at the files in this order:
`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> last`
This is important since the card files won't explain a concept if it has already been explained in a card before it.

1: These are the essentials, showing you the structure of cards and a little bit of code.
2: These are a bit more advanced, where you will be modifying some values.
3: This is where you will write more actual code. (It can get overwhelming quick, sorry)
4: These are the most advanced concepts so far.
DIY: These are cards that have a description but no functionality by default. You have to write the code yourself, and play the card in-game to verify your solution.
Test: These are cards that are used for unit tests, but they also contain some more niche topics. This stage assumes you have read all numbered stages.
