For step 1:
Look in `game.interact`. There is a further hint down below.

For step 2:
Look at the different methods for the target.








SPOILERS FURTHER DOWN. BE WARNED!






































































































































`game.functions.interact.prompt.target` or `game.functions.interact.prompt.targetCard` is the method to use.
(you can replace `game.functions.interact.prompt.target` with `game.functions.interact.prompt.targetCard`, it is what i recommend in this situation)

Make sure to set the `target` to the return value.

Criterias to solve the card are the following:
1. You NEED to use `prompt.target` or `prompt.targetCard`.
2. When using `prompt.target`, you need to set the following parameters:
    a. `card` = self                // The caller is the diy card (`self`)
    b. Set `class` flag to "minion" // Don't force a side. The description says: Choose a minion. Not: Choose a FRIENDLY minion, or Choose an ENEMY minion.
3. You need to have set the `target` variable, and it needs to be killed (no health and in the graveyard).
