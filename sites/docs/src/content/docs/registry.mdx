title: Registry Failed

If you're seeing this, the registry is not set up correctly.

If you're a normal user, try again later.

If you're a site admin, the issue is that the reverse proxy that would otherwise redirect `/registry` requests to the actual registry doesn't work. \
It's likely that the reverse proxy isn't configured properly. Check the logs for the reverse proxy, and troubleshoot from there.
