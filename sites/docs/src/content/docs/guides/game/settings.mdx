You can find the settings by opening the `config.ts` file in your favorite text/code editor.

The file will look something like this:

```ts
// config.ts

export const config: GameConfig = {
    general: {
        // The locale (aka. language) to use. If the specified locale doesn't exist, it will default to 'en_US'.
		    locale: "en_US",

        /*
		     * The editor that gets launched whenever the game wants to launch an editor.
		     * This happens after creating a card using the Custom Card Creator, for example.
		     * You can set this to any path you want. (e.g. /usr/bin/code or vim)
		     */
		    editor: "code",

        // ...
    },

    decks: {
        /*
		     * If the game should validate deck codes.
		     * If this is disabled, the game will accept ANY correctly formatted deckcode.
		     */
		    validate: true,
        
        // ...
    },

    debug: {
        /*
		     * If this is enabled, ALL debug settings under this category gets enabled.
		     *
		     * Disable this to pick and choose which debug settings to enable.
		     */
		    all: true,

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

Every setting will be in a category, and will have a description above it. You can, for example, disable debug mode by changing `Debug > All` to `false`.

I won't go over every setting and what they do here, since they're already explained in the file itself.
