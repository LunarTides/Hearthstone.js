title: IDs, UUIDs, and Names

The differences between ids, uuids, and names of cards is something I expect would be confusing, so I will try my best to explain.

## Names
Names are the easiest to explain. They can be anything, and are non-unique.

The name of a card can be access through `card.name`.

## IDs
IDs need to be unique **per blueprint**. This means that every instance of the Sheep card as defined by the blueprint in the `cards/sheep-668b9054.ts` file needs to share the same id:
`668b9054-7ca9-49af-9dd9-4f0126c6894c`. 

You can see in this picture that the 3 Sheep share the same id. (`#668b90`) \

The id of a card can be access through `card.id`.

## UUIDs
UUIDs need to be unique **per card**. Every card *needs* to have a different uuid.

You can see this in this picture that the 3 Sheep have unique uuids. (`@db8df1a`, `@e7a2c92`, `@5b7ede7`) \

The uuid of a card can be access through `card.uuid`.
