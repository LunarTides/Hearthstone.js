This is the generator you'll likely use the most. It allows you to create a custom card, with no restrictions.

## Running
To run the custom card creator, do the following steps:

<Steps>

1. From the HUB, select `Developer Options`:
![Selecting "Developer Options" from the HUB.](../../../../../../assets/guides/creating/cards/developer-options.webp)

2. Then select `Create a Card`:
![Selecting "Create a Card" from the HUB.](../../../../../../assets/guides/creating/cards/create-a-card.webp)

3. Then select `Create a Custom Card`:
![Selecting "Create a Custom Card" from the HUB.](../../../../../../assets/guides/creating/cards/create-a-custom-card.webp)

</Steps>

This will take you to a screen that looks like this:

> Sorry for the low resolution.

## Configuring the Card
You can now change any aspect of the card.

### Type
First, you should change the card's **type**.
This can be `Minion`, `Spell`, `Weapon`, etc... It affects the way the game should handle the card.
If you're familiar with Hearthstone, you should know the drill.

### Name
Next up is the name. Take a look at [this guide](../../ids/) to see more information about names.
For now, just know that they can be anything and are non-unique.

### Text
After that is the text. This should explain the card and how it works.
Use [color tags](../../color-tags/) to style the text.

E.g. `Your <b>Battlecries</b> trigger twice.`

### Cost
This is how much mana the card costs.

### Classes
TODO: Explain configuring arrays.

This is the classes the card belongs to. A card belonging to the `Druid` class can't be added to the deck of a `Mage` when creating a deck, for example.

### Rarity
The rarity of the card. This doesn't really do much by itself, other than color the card's name.

### Collectible
If the card should be collectible. If true, the card can be added to decks.
If this is false, the game won't add the card to any lists unless explicitly asked to include uncollectible cards.
