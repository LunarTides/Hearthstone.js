How easy it is the create cards is one of the big features of Hearthstone.js

It's recommended to be atleast somewhat familiar with TypeScript,
but you might be fine with even a redumentary understanding of programming concepts.
*(If statements, for loops, etc...)*

In order to create cards, 
it's recommended to first run a **generator**.
The supported generators currently are *custom* and *vanilla*. Those will be elaborated on in the next guide.

Once you have made a certain amount of cards, you can create a [pack](../packs/introduction/), and upload it to the [registry](../packs/web/).
