Hearthstone.js is a console-based recreation of [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/) by Blizzard.

It is a hobby project made by [LunarTides](https://github.com/LunarTides) (me) that I started working on somewhere between 2021-2022.

It is quite a big project, with many parts, and so I realized that it *probably* needed a guide if I ever wanted someone else to be able to use it.
And so I made one!

Thanks for checking this out, and I hope you enjoy Hearthstone.js!
