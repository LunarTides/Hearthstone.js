## Prerequisites
In order to install Hearthstone.js, you need a few prerequisite things installed.

        <TabItem label="Windows">Hit <Kbd windows="Win+R" />, then type `cmd` and hit enter.</TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Linux">Open your terminal of choice.</TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3. Navigate to the folder you want to download Hearthstone.js to:

    </Tabs>
2. Navigate to your Hearthstone.js folder using `cd`. For example, if you placed the folder in your downloads, run:
    ```bash
    cd Downloads/Hearthstone.js
    ```
3. Install the games' dependencies:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
4. Start the game:
    ```bash
    bun .
    ```

</Steps>
